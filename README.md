The SHP data needed to run the code can be found at: https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/6097/latest/datasets/932/3861/overview.

To run the script, you need to have all individual-specific data (i.e. the shpXX_p_user.dta files where XX goes from 0 to 23 indicating the year) and the same for the household data (i.e. the shpXX_h_user.dta files).

The Worldbank data necessary to run the code is available under: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2022&locations=CH&start=1960&view=chart or the direct download link: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?downloadformat=csv
